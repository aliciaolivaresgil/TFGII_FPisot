	abstract = {Introduction: Half the world population lives in cities and this is likely to increase to 70\% over the next 20 years. Suboptimal urban and transport planning has led to e.g. high levels of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space and physical activity and thereby an increase in morbidity and premature mortality. How can better urban and transport planning improve public health? Methods: A narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary studies and practices on how to improve public health through better urban and transport planning reported in the literature and from meetings over the past few years. Results: We describe the latest quantitative evidence of how cities can become healthier through better urban and transport planning. It focuses and provides evidence for important interventions, policies and actions that can improve public health, including the need for land use changes, reduce car dependency and move towards public and active transportation, greening of cities, visioning, citizen involvement, collaboration, leadership and investment and systemic approaches. Health impact assessment studies have recently provided new powerful quantitative evidence on how to make cities healthier and will be used as examples. At the same time these measures make also our cities more sustainable (i.e. carbon neutral) and liveable creating multiple benefits. Conclusion: Better urban and transport planning can lead to carbon neutral, more liveable and healthier cities, particularly through land use changes, a move from private motorised transportation to public and active transportation and greening of cities. © 2020 The Author},

	abstract = {Purpose: Seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) are included in the UN’s 2030 agenda of sustainable development that aims to provide a shared blueprint for sustainability and call for urgent action by all member countries. The study aims to study the role of tourism in delivering sustainable solutions for the planet. Research Methodology: The present chapter compiles available studies on sustainable tourism and critically analyses sustainability principles and their relevance to SDGs. Findings: The chapter comprehensively studies the SDGs - 8, 12, and 14 and reveals a strategic roadmap to achieve the SDGs through sustainable tourism practices. The observations may provide deep insights to the government and policymakers to prioritise actions in order to achieve the goals. Research Limitations: Future research studies may be conducted to empirically verify the results from the perspective of different countries. Practical Implications: According to United Nations (2023), ‘The tourism sector accounts for approximately 10\% of the world’s GDP, about 30\% of overall service exports across sectors, and provides for 1 out of 10 jobs globally’. Sustainable tourism has particularly been embraced as an important area under the 8th SDG of sustainable economic growth; in the 12th SDG of sustainable production and consumption and in the 14th SDG pertaining to sustainable use of oceans and marine resources, thus highlighting its importance. Value: The chapter is a novel attempt to comprehensively analyse the role of sustainable tourism and the strategic roadmap for achieving the SDGs. © 2024 by Jatin Vaid.},

	abstract = {Cities attracting large numbers of tourists increasingly face crowding and public resistance to tourism growth. As a result, governments strive to spread tourists from the best-known attractions to less-visited locations to improve both residents’ and tourists’ quality of life. Evidence of success and best practices herein is largely anecdotal, and the effects on tourist experience are also unknown. Thus, we undertook a randomized 2 × 2 experiment in the province of Overijssel (The Netherlands), wherein tourists staying at vacation parks near small and mid-sized cities were exposed to information which emphasized attractions in either heavily visited or less-visited areas. Participants were also assigned to receive the information in either a passive or a conversational form. Location and daily emotion, as well as experience evaluation on the last day of the vacation, were recorded via mobile platforms. We found that tourists receiving information on attractions in less-visited areas engaged in significantly more movements around these attractions, and significantly less around heavily visited areas. The conversational form of information delivery was more positively evaluated than information delivered passively. Furthermore, vacation experience emotions and evaluations were largely unaffected. Thus, it is clearly possible to direct tourists to less-crowded locations without negatively affecting their vacation experiences. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The 2030 Agenda for sustainable development emphasizes the interconnectedness of environmental issues with socio-economic development, recognizing their fundamental role in human prosperity, while the sustainable development goals (SDGs) serve as a pivotal framework globally. This study provides a critical assessment of the progress made by EU Member States in pursuing the SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) targets as set out in the 2030 Agenda. The analysis is based on official data published by the EU Statistical Office—Eurostat—and uses the AAA (Holt-Winters) exponential smoothing algorithm for the trend analysis of specific indicators. The results show significant progress during the first seven years of implementation of the Agenda 2023, while indicating concerns about the achievement of the 2030 targets in some Member States. The mapping of potentially negative trends emphasizes the need for firm corrective actions, underlining the urgency of early interventions to address expected negative developments before they have potentially irreversible consequences. © 2024 by the authors.},
